Welcome to Board Buddy!

My friends and I like to play chess, but the problem is: we suck. We're trying to find ways to improve, but everything online is so restricted, requiring you to pay for their services (I'm looking at you Chess.com).

The solution we came up with? Board Buddy! Board Buddy is a free-to-use platform that allows the user to input a chess game in the form of algebraic chess notation. After entering their game, the program sorts through the database to find games that closely resemble the inputted game via a complex, top-secret algorithm (mergesort / quicksort). These sorts order the games based on their similarity scores with the inputted game, allowing the user to compare their game with the top n similar games. We want to test which sort would work best. Thus, the user can decide which sort he/she would like to use. We hope to collect enough data from each sort in order to settle, helping us determine which sort is better. We also hope that this project will help you all improve your chess abilities.

Thank you for your interest in Board Buddy, and we hope you enjoy!
